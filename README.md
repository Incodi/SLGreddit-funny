This is a joke project for a post on r/SLGreddit that matches the theme of the posts there.

## Here's some background:

I watch a lot of Youtube, and I have grown up with it. 
Back in 2013-2018, I really liked to watch a Youtuber called SSundee.
I also watched other Minecraft Youtubers like ExplodingTNT and BajanCanadian, but my old obsession with SSundee is relevant to this.
SSundee used to play with Youtubers like Team Crafted (a group of YTers), LanceyPooh, and Crainer.
Starting from August 2014, he played mostly with Crainer, and I loved the duo they created, "Crundee."
I really liked the Skyfactory, TrollCraft, and the Lucky Block series they did.

In 2018, SSundee went on a hiatus and Crainer did videos without SSundee, so I did watch these videos and got more attached to Crainer's personality without SSundee.
After the hiatus, much of the videos with both SSundee and Crainer were Fortnite videos.
I got old and didn't really like Fortnite so I stopped watching. 
However, I did watch a few Fortnite videos to see how the duo was doing. 

In the middle of 2019, Minecraft became popular again and was somewhat outcompeting Fortnite.
SSundee and Crainer jumped in on this trend and started playing Minecraft, with a new series called Camp Minecraft.
I was old and in high school, so I didn't watch this series, but I knew about it through a fan of another Youtuber.

Crainer has stopped playing with SSundee and played with a familiar group with Jelly and Slogo.

I watched the Robust trio (Jelly, Slogo, and Kwebbelkop) back in 2015-2018, and I have so many fond memories of watching their GTA racing funny moments videos. A friend who really liked GTA back then introduced me to them and we watched the videos together.

It was news to me that "Crundee" has broken up and Crainer has joined another Youtube group that I liked, but I was old and the content no longer fit me so I didn't watch the videos with the new group. 

I also stopped playing games, because I didn't have the time and energy to play them anymore :(

A little later (~2 years) I, for some reason, became "young" and really liked to watch videos from Sigils, one of the people who plays with SSundee. Much of his videos are minigames where the SSundee crew just goofs around and the videos are extremely funny and entertaining. SSundee's videos at this time and in the present are aimed at a very young audience, when Sigils's videos are aimed at an older audience. Note, I still didn't return to playing Minecraft as much as I did when I was younger :(

By Youtube recommendations, I started watching some newer Slogo videos, and also fell in love with the dynamic between Jelly, Slogo, and Crainer. This trio is usually described negatively by critics, mostly with that they aren't as skilled as other big Youtubers or the videos are low quality, but the videos were nostalgic to me and I loved the personalities and dynamic. 

By some time in 2022, Crainer stopped appearing in Jelly or Slogo's videos due to his personal problems, which made me stop watching them :(

But I still watched Sigils, which made me keep in touch with the community.

Jelly and Slogo fell off in views dramatically during Crainer's absence, this drop isn't only due to Crainer not being in the videos but due to the lack of new games to play, Minecraft's and GTA's decreasing popularity, scandals around some Youtubers, the rise of TikTok and Youtube Shorts, and so on. 

To deal with the issue of a missing member (missing third), Jelly and Slogo made a podcast called two/thirds where they talk about various things with a focus on obtaining a new member. 

The podcast ends with Jelly and Slogo not getting a brand new member but Crainer returning to the group.

The reunion starts the beginning of one of their best Minecraft series, Squid Island, which I loved to watch.

At some point within the series, the trio wanted the community to vote which member of the trio they want to make president within the series. This began the Reddit-based community around Jelly, Slogo, and Crainer.

They have had 3 active subreddits at a point in time: r/SquidIsland (which is down now), r/CherryIsland (inactive now), r/SLGreddit (very active at this time).

I posted a lot of fanart in these subreddits, which I made for fun, and I used my old 2018 Reddit account named smoresaretasty to post these.

To continue to the next part about my activity within the community, I need to talk about SLG and Jelly leaving the trio.

So when Squid Island ended, Squid Isles was made, and that ended...

So very strangely, for a long time after the reunion, Slogo and Crainer were becoming really close to each other mostly on a channel, which I really like, called SLG. Jelly felt left out and he left the trio, leaving Slogo and Crainer to do their own things. 

Cherry Island continued after Squid Isles and in that series we see a possible candidate for a third member, Fin.
Cherry Island seemed to have ended at the time of writing.

I have watched SLG videos since Squid Island was ongoing, much of the videos were reaction videos at that time, and I viewed the videos as gold as Slogo and Crainer have the best reactions in my opinion.

The videos changed to become more diverse over time with some high quality videos. This includes a Reddit review series. Note, the Reddit reviews started before Jelly left the group.

I posted random art in the SLG subreddit, and one of my fanart became a base for Crainer's new logo.
This fanart was an version of the "This is Fine" meme with an element from an inside joke where the community gave Crainer a bunch of nicknames. One of my old friends was also in the subreddit and he made a 2000+ word list of nicknames. I used this list with permission and made an artwork where Crainer was surrounded by nicknames, like capybara, cassowary, computer, crane operator, etc.

So, I drew the new logo based on Crainer's expression in the artwork. 
I also drew his banner (2 versions), and a merch design. 

Now based on the logo, I have created a version of the endless horse website that is based on another inside joke in the community that Crainer has a large forehead. This was made completely for fun. This community is interesting lol.
